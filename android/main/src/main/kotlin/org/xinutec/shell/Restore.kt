/**
 * Which pages may become the app's restore point — the URL a cold launch reopens on.
 *
 * Only pages of the app itself. The OAuth hops (`/login`, `/auth/callback`) are
 * transient: the callback carries a **one-shot** authorization code, so replaying it
 * always fails. Saving one as the restore point turns a single failed login into a
 * permanent one — every launch reloads a spent callback, is refused, and never reaches
 * the app to try again. That is not hypothetical: it happened to the fleetwatch wrapper
 * on the Pixel 9 (2026-07-28), which could not recover on its own.
 *
 * Applied to every wrapper, including the two with no login at all: a rule that only
 * holds where someone remembered to copy it is the rule that stranded fleetwatch.
