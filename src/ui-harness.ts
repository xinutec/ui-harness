 * Change here → run this package's own fixture specs (npm test) — five

 *
 * The core signal is text-on-text collision. In a correct layout, no two
 * pieces of text ever share the same pixels. We measure each piece of
 * rendered text at the glyph level — `Range.getClientRects()` returns one
 * box per *visual line*, so wrapping is handled and a paragraph that wraps
 * around an inline `<b>` doesn't produce one giant union box that spuriously
